This is my week 1 lab report for CSE 15L. In this lab report, I will be describing the neccesary steps to log into a course-specific account on ieng6. The first step towards creating a course-specific account would be installing VScode on your device. Since my device already had VScode installed on it, I didn't install VScode in order to create my course-specific account. However, in order to install VScode on your device, you would need to visit the Visual Studio Code website at  https://code.visualstudio.com/.

After entering that command into the terminal, you will be asked if you want to continue connecting to the server since this is probably your first time connecting to that server. After typing "yes" to the message, you will be asked to enter your password in order to connect to the server. After entering your password, you will be logged into the remote server and your terminal should display the following message.

After connecting to a remote server, you should try out some commands on the remote server and on your own computer. The image belows gives an example of trying out some commands on the remote server. 

The commands that I used are the "pwd" and "ls -a" commands. The pwd command, which stands for "print working directory" gives the absolote path of the directory that the user is currently in. The

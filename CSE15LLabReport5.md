This is my lab report 5 for CSE 15L. In this lab report I will discuss my favorite lab activity over the course of the entire quarter. My favorite lab activity was our Week 2 lab activity of setting up and running our own web server in Java. I will descibe the step by step details of what made this activity my favorite one and how I completed it.

1.) Initial Inability To Complete Activity In Lab

Initially, when the lab activity was first assigned to us in the Week 2 lab whereby we had to create our own Search Engine using our local device, I found the Server.java and NumberServer.java files difficult to understand. Due to being unable to understand the code, I wasn't able to get the task of creating my own Search Engine done by the end of the lab.

2.) Understanding the Implementation of the NumberServer.java File

After being unable to complete the task of creating my own Search Engine, I tried to understand the implementation of the code in NumberServer.java on my own. I understood how the handleRequest method worked and how the query part of the method worked. After understanding the implementation of the code in NumberServer.java, I tried to implement the StringServer.java file required for our Lab Report 2.

3.) Implementing StringServer.java and Completing Lab Report 2

After understanding the implementation of NumberServer.java, I tried to implement StringServer.java. StringServer.java implemented a server which concatenated a string to an already existing string and returning the modified string. My implementation of the file is given in the image below.

The method handleRequest updated/modified a string called "yum" by concatenating the string "yum1", which is the string after the "=" sign in the URL, to the original string "yum" and then returning it. I was able to implement this file and method after spending a lot of time trying to understand the implementation of the NumberServer.java file and after trying many different ways of implementing StringServer.java itself. This was how I was able to get the Week 2 lab report done.
